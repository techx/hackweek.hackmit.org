We will use two distance sensors--one to control pitch and one to control volume and they will react to how far the user\'s hand is from each sensor. This workshops will be aimed at people who know the basics of coding and want a cool project to help them learn more. It is an adaptation of the alarm-clock-theremin-art-instalation that we along with a team of four others made for Make Cool SHMIT and we are really exited to share it :)',

I would also explain how can be built a pocket oscilloscope using an Arduino. In this manner, I would also present which are the benefits of using high end microcontrollers, and also the difference of choosing a FPGA instead. The systems which will be presented will be able to perform from 1MSPS up to 100MSPS. I will also talk about the advantages of doing the signal processing part in the FPGA, and why is faster than a computer. Turn Hardware into Easyware with JavaScript (Cyrus Roshan, Akhilesh Yarabarla), Want to make cool hardware hacks but barely know C++? Have a project idea that needs too much cpu and memory for a simple arduino to handle? Need to easily control your hack from your laptop? Here\'s how to make the coolest but easiest hardware hack you\'ve ever made!',
